# The Open Data Platform API

***This project has been merged into [Open-Data-Platform](https://github.com/SAEONData/Open-Data-Platform).***

Provides a stable interface to ODP back-end systems, with automatic API documentation using the
OpenAPI standard. API requests are fulfilled by _adapters_ configured to handle particular routes.

## Installation

### System dependencies

* Python 3.6

### Project dependencies

* [ODP-AccountsLib](https://github.com/SAEONData/ODP-AccountsLib)

## Configuration

The system is configured using environment variables. For a local / non-containerised deployment,
these may be loaded from a `.env` file located in the project root directory. See `.env.example`
for an example configuration.

### Environment variables

#### Global

- **`SERVER_ENV`**: deployment environment; `development` | `testing` | `staging` | `production`
- **`PATH_PREFIX`**: (optional) URL path prefix at which the API is mounted, e.g. `/api`
- **`ALLOW_ORIGINS`**: (optional) list of allowed CORS origins; `["*"]` to allow any origin
- **`ACCOUNTS_API_URL`**: URL of the ODP Accounts API, for access token validation and introspection
- **`NO_AUTH`**: optional, default `False`; set to `True` to disable access token validation

#### Routers

Router-specific environment variables are prefixed with the uppercased name of the router module,
e.g. `METADATA.ADAPTER`, etc. Following are the options that are applicable per router:

- **`<ROUTER>.ADAPTER`**: class name of the adapter that will fulfil requests to the router
- **`<ROUTER>.OAUTH2_SCOPE`**: OAuth2 scope applicable to the router
- **`<ROUTER>.READONLY_ROLES`**: list of roles that may read resources via this router;
if the router is institution-aware, the resources must belong to the same institution as the user
- **`<ROUTER>.READWRITE_ROLES`**: list of roles that may read and write resources via this router;
if the router is institution-aware, the resources must belong to the same institution as the user
- **`<ROUTER>.ADMIN_ROLES`**: list of roles that may read and write resources belonging
to _any_ institution, and that may access administrative functions, via this router

Note: list-type options should be entered as JSON-encoded lists without spaces between items, e.g.

    METADATA.READWRITE_ROLES=["contributor","curator"]

The `*_ROLES` options are optional, defaulting to the empty list `[]`, i.e. no roles allowed
access of the specified type.

## Adapters

An adapter (e.g. [ODP-API-CKANAdapter](https://github.com/SAEONData/ODP-API-CKANAdapter)) consists
of a class that inherits from `odpapi.adapters.ODPAPIAdapter`, along with a corresponding `-Config`
class that inherits from `odpapi.adapters.ODPAPIAdapterConfig`. These classes should be defined in
a module (or modules) located under an `odpapi_adapters` namespace package in the adapter project
directory. The adapter is enabled by installing it into the same Python environment as the ODP API,
and setting the applicable `<ROUTER>.ADAPTER` environment variable(s) for router(s) that should use
the adapter.

The adapter class contains methods that fulfil adapter calls as defined in one or more `odpapi.routers.*`
modules. The adapter's config class should define an environment variable prefix (e.g. `'FOOBAR_ADAPTER.'`),
and may define additional settings as needed, which will also be automatically loaded from the
environment at startup.

## Development quick start

Install the Uvicorn ASGI server into the project's virtual environment:

    pip install uvicorn

Run the server:

    uvicorn odpapi:app --reload
